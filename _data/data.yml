    title: Research
    intro: >
      My research focuses on making robotics and cyberphysical systems
      safe, and improving the quality assurance of these systems. For this
      purpose I have done a number of empirical studies that identifies the
      challenges and bottlenecks of automated testing in robotics. In addition,
      I have developed tools and benchmarks towards building an automated testing
      pipeline for robotic systems.

      In addition, over the years I have also worked on automatic program repair,
      where given a faulty program and a set of test cases (some of which are failing),
      patches are automatically generated in a way that the final program passes
      all the test cases.

    assignments:
      - title: Robotics Quality Assurance
        #link: "#hook"
        tagline: "In this project, we discover and develop powerful methods to
        automatically detect, localize and fix defects in real-world
        autonomous systems using low-fidelity, software-based simulation."

      - title: SOSRepair
        link: "https://github.com/squaresLab/SOSRepair"
        tagline: "Automatic program repair tool which generates high quality
        patches by replacing the buggy fragment of code with a correct
        implementation that is already written by developers
        in maybe some other project."

      - title: CoBlox
        link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVQLQhVWdHg"
        tagline: "In this project, with inspiration from block-based
        programming languages, initially designed as an introductory
        programming environment for education, we created CoBlox,
        a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot."

presentations:
    - title: "Panel: Software Quality in Robotics"
      abstract: "A robot is only as good as the software that runs it. This panel
      addresses questions related to software quality in robotics. While there
      have been vast improvements in many areas of robotics, the quality of the end
      product is always constrained by the quality of the software that underlies
      the system. Panelists have worked with software quality in robotics in general
      and ROS in particular and will include perspectives from both industry and academia.
      Topics include: the current state of the art in quality assurance practices
      for robotics; the role of simulation; promoting quality through good development
      practices; ways to improve testing; software quality in projects with
      participants of different backgrounds; and unique quality features of the ROS ecosystem."

    - title: "A developer perspective on the challenges of automated testing for robots"
      abstract: "How do robotics developers test their systems? What are the main
      challenges of testing robots? Is it possible to automatically test robots in
      simulation? In this talk, I present the findings of several empirical studies
      with robotics developers, conducted by our research group, designed to identify
      both the state of the practice and challenges faced by developers when testing
      their systems. Considering the importance of test automation, and the potential
      of simulation-based testing, I will focus on presenting the challenges and
      bottlenecks of test automation for robotics, and how they are impacted by the
      capabilities of existing simulators."
